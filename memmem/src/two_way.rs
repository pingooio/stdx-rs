    This is the Two-Way search algorithm, which was introduced in the paper:
    Crochemore, M., Perrin, D., 1991, Two-way string-matching, Journal of the ACM 38(3):651-675.

    Here's some background information.

    A *word* is a string of symbols. The *length* of a word should be a familiar
    notion, and here we denote it for any word x by |x|.
    (We also allow for the possibility of the *empty word*, a word of length zero).

    If x is any non-empty word, then an integer p with 0 < p <= |x| is said to be a
    *period* for x iff for all i with 0 <= i <= |x| - p - 1, we have x[i] == x[i+p].
    For example, both 1 and 2 are periods for the string "aa". As another example,
    the only period of the string "abcd" is 4.

    We denote by period(x) the *smallest* period of x (provided that x is non-empty).
    This is always well-defined since every non-empty word x has at least one period,
    |x|. We sometimes call this *the period* of x.

    If u, v and x are words such that x = uv, where uv is the concatenation of u and
    v, then we say that (u, v) is a *factorization* of x.

    Let (u, v) be a factorization for a word x. Then if w is a non-empty word such
    that both of the following hold

      - either w is a suffix of u or u is a suffix of w
      - either w is a prefix of v or v is a prefix of w

    then w is said to be a *repetition* for the factorization (u, v).

    Just to unpack this, there are four possibilities here. Let w = "abc". Then we
    might have:

      - w is a suffix of u and w is a prefix of v. ex: ("lolabc", "abcde")
      - w is a suffix of u and v is a prefix of w. ex: ("lolabc", "ab")
      - u is a suffix of w and w is a prefix of v. ex: ("bc", "abchi")
      - u is a suffix of w and v is a prefix of w. ex: ("bc", "a")

    Note that the word vu is a repetition for any factorization (u,v) of x = uv,
    so every factorization has at least one repetition.

    If x is a string and (u, v) is a factorization for x, then a *local period* for
    (u, v) is an integer r such that there is some word w such that |w| = r and w is
    a repetition for (u, v).

    We denote by local_period(u, v) the smallest local period of (u, v). We sometimes
    call this *the local period* of (u, v). Provided that x = uv is non-empty, this
    is well-defined (because each non-empty word has at least one factorization, as
    noted above).

    It can be proven that the following is an equivalent definition of a local period
    for a factorization (u, v): any positive integer r such that x[i] == x[i+r] for
    all i such that |u| - r <= i <= |u| - 1 and such that both x[i] and x[i+r] are
    defined. (i.e. i > 0 and i + r < |x|).

    Using the above reformulation, it is easy to prove that

        1 <= local_period(u, v) <= period(uv)

    A factorization (u, v) of x such that local_period(u,v) = period(x) is called a
    *critical factorization*.

    The algorithm hinges on the following theorem, which is stated without proof:

    **Critical Factorization Theorem** Any word x has at least one critical
    factorization (u, v) such that |u| < period(x).

    The purpose of maximal_suffix is to find such a critical factorization.

    If the period is short, compute another factorization x = u' v' to use
    for reverse search, chosen instead so that |v'| < period(x).
